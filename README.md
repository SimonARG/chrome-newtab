# SimonARG's custom Chrome new tab
Replaces Google Chrome's new tab page with a customizeable one.

This project was originally started because I wanted to be able to see Chrome's bookmark topbar, but only in the "new tab" page. However, this was not possible, and having the topbar on every website was annoying. This project's main feature is a custom rendering of Chrome bookmarks.

### Usage:

1.  Download the project [as a .zip](https://github.com/SimonARG/chrome-newtab/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Unzip download contents into a folder of your choosing.
3. Run `setup.bat` to create resource folders.
4. Head to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
5. Toggle **Developer mode** in the top right.
6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where the new tab was unzipped.
7. Your folder will appear as an extension, you can now toggle developer mode off and open a new tab.

- Click the gear icon in the bottom left to change the tab title, favicon, the background image, and to add a new shortcut.

- Right-click a shortcut to edit or remove it.
