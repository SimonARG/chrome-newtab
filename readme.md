This project, when side-loaded as a Chrome extension, replaces the default `new tab` landing page with a customized one. This includes:

* Setting a background image or gif.
* Setting a custom tab favicon.
* Custom rendering of native Chrome bookmarks.
* Adding, editing or removing shortcuts.
* Searching the internet.

### Usage:

1.  Download the project [as a .zip](https://github.com/SimonARG/chrome-newtab/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Unzip download contents into a folder of your choosing.
3. Run `setup.bat` to create resource folders.
4. Head to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
5. Toggle **Developer mode** in the top right.
6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where the new tab was unzipped.
7. Your folder will be loaded to Chrome as an extension, you can now toggle developer mode off and open a new tab.
* Icons for shortcuts should be located in /imgs/logos, while browser favicons and background images whould be at /imgs/.
